# Foundry V1.0 Design Paper

This document describes a provisional design of Foundry v1.0. This version is expected to be fully autonomous once built, with no need of centralized control or management.

Much of this document focuses on the particular kind of Liquid Democracy that Foundry will employ, to enable FRY holders to control Foundry.
